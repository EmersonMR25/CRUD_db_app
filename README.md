# CRUD Database application with flask/SQLite

A simple web application that allows users to add, edit, and delete user records, including their name, age, and hobby. The application uses Flask for the backend, SQLite for the database, and Bootstrap for the frontend UI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- SQLite3
- Bootstrap (via CDN)
- Jinja2 (included with Flask)

## How to Run the App

1. Make sure you're in the project directory and that your virtual environment is activated.

2. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open a browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

   You will be able to add, edit, and delete users from the interface.

## Credits

This application was developed by Emerson Romero. The frontend is styled with Bootstrap and acquired from Sudu2411's Github page and modified by Chatgpt to meet my requirements, and the backend logic is powered by Flask and SQLite.
